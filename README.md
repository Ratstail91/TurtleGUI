## Outline

TurtleGUI requires SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf. Other than that, it should be a self contained package.

## Contents

* Image - For loading and rendering an image to the screen
* Button - For on-screen buttons that can be clicked
* TextLine - For rendering a single line of text to the screen
* TextBox - A collection of TextLines, and utilities for managing them
* TextField - For inputting text, rendered to the screen
* Vector2 - I don't know where else to put this
